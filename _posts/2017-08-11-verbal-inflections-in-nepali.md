In Nepali, verbs exhibit rich inflectional patterns, allowing for intricate nuances in meaning and expression. This richness stems from the language's extensive conjugation system, where verbs undergo various inflectional changes to convey details such as tense, aspect, mood, person, number, and honorifics. The combination of suffixation and sometimes auxiliary verbs enables Nepali verbs to capture a wide array of cultural nuances. For example, verbs can inflect to denote not only the time of an action but also its duration, completion status, and the speaker's attitude towards it. Additionally, Nepali verbs also inflect for honorifics to reflects the speaker's respect for the subject. 

Nepali verbs inflect to encode: Tense, Aspect, Mood, Person, Number, Gender and Honorifics.

## Tense (काल)

In Nepali, verbs exhibit three tenses to signify the timing of an action in relation to the moment of speaking: Past (भुत काल), Present (वर्तमान काल) and Future (भविष्यत काल). 
```
Past (भुत काल): खायो (khaa-yo)
Present (वर्तमान काल): खान्छ (khaa-n-cha)
Future (भविष्यत काल): खानेछु (khaa-ne-chu)
```

## Aspect (पक्ष)

While tense tells us when an action occurs, aspect tells us how that action unfolds or is perceived. In Nepali, verbs can be inflected to express 4 aspects: Perfect (पूर्ण पक्ष), Habitual (अभ्यस्त पक्ष), Imperfect (अपूर्ण पक्ष) and Inferential (अज्ञात पक्ष).

### Perfect Aspect (पूर्ण पक्ष)

The perfect aspect of a verb indicates that the action has been completed prior to the current moment. In Nepali grammar, the presence of the suffix "एको" (eko) signals the perfect aspect. Notably, the suffix "एको" (eko) undergoes inflection to match the number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine) of the subject involved in the action. Examples: खाएको (khaa-eko), खाएका (khaa-yeka)
```
Examples of Perfect Aspect (पूर्ण पक्ष) Verbs
खाएको (kha-eko) - masculine, singular
खाएका (kha-eka) - masculine, plural
खाएकी (kha-eki) - feminine, singular
खाएका (kha-eko) - feminine, plural
```

### Imperfect Aspect (अपूर्ण पक्ष)

Imperfect aspect denotes an action that is in progress or ongoing. In Nepali grammar, this aspect is indicated by specific suffixes such as "दै" (dai), "दो" (do), "दी" (dii), and "दा" (da). These suffixes serve to highlight the ongoing nature of the action, suggesting that it is not yet complete or finalized. Examples: खाँदै (khaa-dai), खाँदा (khaa-daa)
```
Examples of Imperfect Aspect (पूर्ण पक्ष) Verbs
खाँदो(kha-do), खाँदै(kha-dai) - masculine, singular
खाँदा(kha-da), खाँदै(kha-dai) - masculine, plural
खाँदी(kha-di), खाँदै(kha-dai) - feminine, singular
खाँदा(kha-da), खाँदै(kha-dai) - feminine, plural
```

### Habitual Aspect (अभ्यस्त पक्ष)

Habitual aspect depicts actions that occur regularly or habitually. It conveys the idea of actions that are customary or repeatedly performed. In Nepali grammar, the habitual aspect is represented by variants of the suffixes "छ" (cha) and "थ्" (th). These suffixes inflect to encode the person, number, gender, and levels of honorifics associated with the subject.

```
Examples of Habitual Aspect (अभ्यस्त पक्ष) Verbs
खान्छु (kha-n-chu), खान्थे (kha-n-the) - first person, inclusive, singular

```

### Inferential Aspect (अज्ञात पक्ष)

Inferential aspect in Nepali is used to describe actions that have occurred in the past but are only known or inferred in the present, often based on indirect evidence or hearsay. In Nepali grammar, the occurrence of the suffixes "ए" (e) and "इ" (i) between the verb stem and the forms of "छ" (cha) indicates the inferential aspect. These suffixes serve to imply that the action, while not directly observed or experienced, is deduced or inferred to have taken place.

```

## Honorifics

In Nepali language, honorifics play a significant role in social interactions, influencing verb forms to express different levels of respect in speech. Second and third person verb forms can undergo inflection to reflect three distinct grades of honorifics: casual, familiar, and respectful. These honorifics are chosen based on the level of formality and the relationship between the speaker and the listener. 

### Casual Honorifics

Casual honorifics are used when addressing juniors or friends in a casual setting. The language used is informal and relaxed, reflecting a close relationship between the speaker and the listener. 
```
तँ (You, singular) - Casual Honorific
  तँ खान्छस् (kha-n-chas)
```

### Familiar Honorifics

The second grade of honorific, familiar honorifics, is employed when speaking to friends, acquaintances, or colleagues. It is more formal compared to casual honorifics and is considered appropriate for most social interactions.
```
तिमी (You, singular) - Familiar Honorific
  तिमी खान्छौ (kha-n-chau)
```
### Respectful Honorifics

Respectful honorifics are used while addressing seniors or elders, as well as individuals deserving of utmost respect. Verbs inflected with respectful honorifics exhibit a high level of respect and formality. 
```
